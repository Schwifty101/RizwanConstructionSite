-- DEFINITIVE FIX: Complete RLS Policy Reset and Proper Configuration
-- This will resolve all CRUD and upload issues by cleaning up conflicting policies
-- Run this script in Supabase SQL Editor

-- Remove all conflicting policies for services

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated can manage services" ON services;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on services" ON services;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all services" ON services;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage services" ON services;

-- Remove all storage policies (these may cause permission errors, but we'll try)
